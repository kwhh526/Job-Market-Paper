	abstract = {The impacts of a major hurricane on residential real estate can be devastating. Hurricane Sandy in New York City (NYC) is among the examples of how flooding can unexpectedly extend beyond FEMA flood zones. Such surprises or negative shocks can provide property owners—especially those not flooded—with new information about future flood risks, based on the difference of the property distance from the mapped flood zone and the distance to the actual locations of flooding. We use a difference-in-differences approach to quantify the effects of these shocks on residential property values for non-flooded NYC properties after Sandy. The short-run negative “surprise” effect was to lower NYC housing prices by about 6\%–7\% for each mile (or about 2\% per standard deviation) difference between the property distance from the flood zone and the distance to the actual locations of flooding. The corresponding positive “surprise” effect is insignificant. The long-term surprise effects of flood risk on housing prices tend to disappear, as residents’ memories of the surprise fade and they seem to only recall the actual storm surge several years after the hurricane.},

	abstract = {People adjust to the risks presented by natural disasters in a number of ways; they can move out of harms way, they can self protect, or they can insure. This paper uses Hurricane Andrew, the largest U.S. natural disaster prior to Katrina, to evaluate how people and housing markets respond to a large disaster. Our analysis combines a unique ex post database on the storm’s damage along with information from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses in Dade County, Florida where the storm hit. The results suggest that the economic capacity of households to adjust explains most of the differences in demographic groups’ patterns of adjustment to the hurricane damage. Low income households respond primarily by moving into low-rent housing in areas that experienced heavy damage. Middle income households move away to avoid risk, and the wealthy, for whom insurance and self-protection are most affordable, appear to remain. This pattern of adjustment with respect to income is roughly mean neutral, so an analysis based on measures of central tendency such as median income would miss these important adjustments.},

	abstract = {The housing rental market offers a unique laboratory for studying price stickiness. This paper is motivated by two facts: 1. Tenants’ rents are remarkably sticky even though regular and expected recontracting would, by itself, suggest substantial rent flexibility. 2. Rent stickiness varies significantly across structure type; for example, detached unit rents are far stickier than large apartment unit rents. We offer the first theoretical explanation of rent stickiness that is consistent with these facts. In this theory, search and bargaining with incomplete information generates stickiness in the absence of menu costs or other commonly used modeling assumptions. Tenants’ valuations of their units, and whether they are considering other units, are both private information. At lease end, the behavior of risk-averse landlords differs according to the number of units managed. Multi-unit landlords, aided by the law of large numbers, exploit tenant moving costs. When renegotiating rent contracts, they set rent increases that exceed the inflation rate; while the majority of tenants stay, those who place low value on the unit search elsewhere and leave. Landlords with one unit loathe vacancy and offer tenants the identical contract to pre-empt search; only those who really hate the unit leave.},

Some argue new market-rate development produces a supply effect, which should alleviate the demand pressure on existing housing units and decrease their rents. Others contend that new development will attract high-income households and new amenities, generating an amenity effect and driving up rents. I contribute to this debate by estimating the impact of new high-rises on nearby residential rents, residential property sales prices and restaurant openings in New York City. To address the selection bias that developers are more likely to build new high-rises in fast-appreciating areas, I restrict the sample to residential properties near approved new high-rises and exploit the plausibly exogenous timing of completion conditional upon the timing of approval. I provide event study evidence that within 500 ft, for every 10\% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease by 1\%; and for every 10\% increase in the condo stock, condo sales prices decrease by 0.9\%. In addition, I show that new high-rises attract new restaurants, which is consistent with the hypothesis about amenity effects. However, I find that the supply effect dominates the amenity effect, causing net reductions in the rents and sales prices of nearby residential properties.},

The intersection of these two trends presents an important challenge for policymakers as well as an insightful test for economic theory. This paper presents a new dataset at this intersection, merging property-level rental outcomes with ZIP code-level hurricane incidence, damage, and government assistance. We construct a panel difference-in-differences model that estimates the effect of the hurricanes from 2000Q1 to 2019Q3 on zip codes throughout the state of Florida. Results indicate that rents per unit and rents per square foot increase by almost 7\% in the quarter following a hurricane, but the effect diminishes over the next 2-4 years. Meanwhile, vacancy rates decrease slightly and then increase sharply and persistently, though their effect also moderates in the later years. The inverse relationship between rent levels and vacancy rates distinguish post-disaster rental markets from regular ones. We propose several possible theoretical explanations for these findings that change our understanding of how rental markets adjust and how some of the most vulnerable members of society are affected by market failures in times of distress.},

vulnerability has many different connotations, depending on the research orientation and perspective (see Chapter 6; also Dow, 1992; Cutter, 2001a). There 
are three main tenets in vulnerability research: the identification of conditions 
that make people or places vulnerable to extreme natural events, an exposure 
model (Burton et al, 1993; Anderson, 2000); the assumption that vulnerability is 
a social condition, a measure of societal resistance or resilience to hazards (Blaikie 
et al, 1994; Hewitt, 1997); and the integration of potential exposures and societal 
resilience with a specific focus on particular places or regions (see Chapter 7; also

Transaction data on Des Moines’ housing market from 2000 to 2012 are used to estimate a hedonic property price function for the region. Both difference-in-differences and triple differences techniques with boundary dummies are used to isolate the impact of the 2008 flood. The main results are as follows. First, the price discount effect of pre-flood risk information is reconfirmed; however, it is overestimated when unobservable neighborhood effects are not controlled for. Second, unexpected inundation during the flood also leads to price discounting. Finally, we find a significant rebounding effect for post-flood prices in the 100-year floodplain areas not actually inundated, while there was no significant change in the 100-year floodplains actually inundated. These findings imply that the housing market updates the risk perception of properties when it receives new flood information. Meanwhile, this price change can affect the income distribution by increasing rents in areas in which the poor usually reside, offering policymakers some insights into how to formulate disaster-related policies.},

Much of the city and its surrounding suburbs were inundated; those residents of the city who had not heeded warnings to flee the approaching storm were evacuated in its wake. In less than a week, the city's population declined from over 400,000 to near zero. Census Bureau estimates indicate that almost two years after the storm, by July 1, 2007, nearly half of these evacuees had yet to return. Will the future New Orleans bear any resemblance to the city that existed prior to Katrina? Most government authorities, from city officials to federal spokespersons, insist that New Orleans must -- and should -- be fully rebuilt. Many environmental scientists question whether such a rebuilding would be sensible, given the city's precarious geological position and the contribution of past land reclamation to the city's current vulnerability. The more basic positive question of whether the city will come back, however, is fundamentally an economic one. After Hurricane Katrina, will the city of New Orleans continue to be a preferred location for more than 400,000 residents and their employers? Or will the disaster shift the city to a new equilibrium level of employment and population?},

	abstract = {We investigate the eﬀects of housing regulations designed to correct a wedge between privately- and socially-optimal construction in areas at risk of ﬂooding in Florida. Using a spatial regression discontinuity around regulatory boundaries and an event study around the policy’s introduction, we document that ﬂoodplain regulation reduces new construction in high-risk areas and increases the share of newly-built houses that are elevated. Embedding these eﬀects in a model of residential choices with elastic housing supply, we ﬁnd that the policy reduces expected ﬂood damages by 60\%. One-quarter of this reduction is driven by relocation of new construction to lower-risk areas, and three-quarters is driven by elevation of houses remaining in risky areas. However, this second-best policy achieves at best about one-tenth of possible welfare gains because of poor targeting. It overcorrects in many areas, inducing more consumers to elevate and relocate than is socially-optimal, while still allowing ineﬃciently-high construction in the riskiest places. By contrast, a ﬂexible corrective tax on ﬂood risk would achieve substantial welfare gains of more than \$2,700 per newly-developed house.},

Our estimates provide robust evidence of a persistent negative impact on flood zone housing values. We show the gradual emergence of a price penalty among flood zone properties that were not damaged by Sandy, reaching 8\% in year 2017 and showing no signs of recovery. In contrast, damaged properties suffered a large immediate drop in value following the storm (17–22\%), followed by a partial recovery and convergence toward a similar penalty as non-damaged properties. The partial recovery in the prices of damaged properties likely reflects their gradual restoration. However, the persistent price reduction affecting all flood-zone properties is more consistent with a learning mechanism.

First, we interact distance to the nearest coastline and flood risk in order to account for these impacts acting together on housing sales prices in our coastal community. Second, we use more granular flood risk measure in the analysis compared to the existing literature. Results show that the hedonic price effect is dependent upon the distance to the nearest coastline, and as expected the distance effect varies by flood risk type. We find that in this coastal housing market properties located in the highest risk flood area, for up to nearly a quarter mile from the nearest coastline, actually command a price premium. A recent movement toward risk‐based flood insurance premiums in the United States was deeply opposed by the real estate sector for fear of causing property values to steeply decline. This analysis sheds some further light on this depressed property value assertion highlighting its sensitivity to distance to the water.},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether a severe flood causes homeowners to update their assessment of flood risk as seen in a change in the price of floodplain property. I use data on all single-family, residential property sales in St. Louis County, Missouri, between 1979 and 2006 in a repeat-sales model and a property fixed-effects model. After the 1993 flood on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, property prices in 100-year floodplains did not change significantly, but prices in 500-year flood-plains declined by between 2\% and 5\%. All property prices in municipalities located on the rivers fell postflood by 6\% to 10\%.},

Lee County, Florida did not experience damage from Andrew. The storm was a “near-miss.” We hypothesize that Andrew conveyed risk information to homeowners in the county. A difference-in-differences (DND) framework identifies the effect of this information on property values in areas likely to experience significant storm damage. The DND findings indicate at least a 19 percent decline in property values.},

Utilizing data from sales of 8,000 single-family residential homes between 1992 and 2002 in Pitt County, North Carolina, an area that experienced significant flooding from Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, we find that a house located within a floodplain has a lower market value than an equivalent house located outside the floodplain. Furthermore, the price discount from locating within a floodplain is significantly larger after Hurricane Floyd than before.},

	abstract = {Hedonic valuation models have shown that sales prices can capitalize property risk factors, such as flood zone; properties facing lower risk sell at a premium, all else being equal. Previous research has indicated that price differentials reflecting risk of flooding become much larger in the wake of a storm. We re-examine these findings for Pitt County, North Carolina, using multiple storm events within a difference-in-differences framework, and we compare flood zone price differentials for a more recent sample of property sales. Prior to Hurricane Fran in 1996, we detect no market risk premium for the presence in a flood zone, but we find significant price differentials after major flooding events, amounting to a 5.7\% decrease after Hurricane Fran and 8.8\% decrease after Hurricane Floyd. Results from a separate model that examines more recent data covering a period without significant storm-related flood impacts indicate a significant risk premium ranging between 6.0\% and 20.2\% for homes sold in the flood zone, but this effect is diminishing over time, essentially disappearing about 5 or 6 years after Hurricane Floyd. The lack of a persistent effect suggests that buyers’ and sellers’ risk perceptions may change with the prevalence of hazard events and that homebuyers are unaware of flood risks and insurance requirements when bidding on properties.},

	abstract = {This study measures the degree to which large public expenditures on wildfire protection subsidize development in harm's way. Using administrative firefighting data, we calculate geographically-differentiated implicit subsidies to homeowners throughout the western USA. We first examine how the presence of homes affects firefighting expenditures. These results are used to reconstruct the implied historical cost of protecting each home and to perform an actuarial calculation of expected future protection cost. The expected net present value of this subsidy can exceed 20\% of a home's value. It increases with fire risk and decreases surprisingly steeply with development density. A simple model is used to explore effects on expansion of developed areas, density, and private risk-reducing investments. These results demonstrate how policy and institutions influence the costs imposed by a changing climate.},

Controlling for exposure to pre-storm risk, we exploit variation in post-storm inundation to identify the impact of storm-induced ﬂooding on establishment survival, employment, and sales revenues. Results indicate that there were economic losses from Sandy and, as expected, they were concentrated among retail businesses with more localized consumer bases. After Sandy, retail establishments exposed to higher surge levels experienced 11 percentage point higher closure rates and 9 percent larger sales revenue declines compared to establishments with less exposure to inundation. In addition, closures were concentrated among standalone establishments. These losses appear to be fairly persistent, showing no sign of recovery to pre-storm levels by 2016. The evidence for jobs is more tentative—at most, they exacerbated an existing downward trend for retail establishments after Sandy.},
